    Surely I shouldn't still be crying for more or less the whole hour after two fucking months?!"

    I work full time and am doing well in my part time degree, I can afford to pay my rent comfortably, 
    although we are getting a new house mate to ease some of the financial pressure. I live with my best friend Brad and his girlfriend Bethany, who I absolutely adore.

    nvl_narrator "We got through the main course in virtual silence, every time anyone asked Haley a question Erin would talk over her and try to block her from the conversation, it got so awkward that silence was the best solution."
    nvl_narrator "A little later on, Haley braved speaking again invited me to join her for a climbing session next time she went, I thought it sounded interesting and agreed to go...Erin on the other hand, saw red and stormed off outside to 'make a call'...I think I was supposed to follow her and reassure her that despite us only spending one night together, she was my one and only, but to be honest, I was just happy for the break. The atmosphere was so tense you could have cut the air with a knife, and even though I hadn't invited her, I felt like the whole situation Erin had caused was my fault."

    nvl_narrator "Following ms.Steel's advice, I made much more of an effort to let people in, not just over the week between that initial session and the next, but over the next few months as well. And not just with Haley, with everyone else too."
    nvl_narrator "It was almost impossible at first, but gradually I managed to speak more and more and volunteered information about myself without other people needing to prize it out of me. It had definitely made life at home better, Bethany and Brad had known me long enough that they knew what I was like, but for Haley I must have seemed like a completely different person to the one she met back in June."
    nvl_narrator "For the first time in years I actually enjoyed Christmas. Normally the thought of so much social activity filled me with nothing but anxiety and I spent a considerable amount of time wishing the whole festive period away."
    nvl_narrator "But this year it was just...well...fun. Our {q}House Mates Only{/q} Christmas party was great and really set the whole holiday up, it was nice for there to be four of us. Haley had slotted in perfectly with us and it was a welcome change to have someone on my team while playing games and someone to sit up with once Bethany and Brad went to bed. My family even commented on how much better I seemed during the few days I spent with them."
    nvl_narrator "The only problem was Erin."
    nvl clear
    nvl_narrator "I had tried for a while to give her the benefit of the doubt and to open up around her...much to Bethany's disgust...and had even ventured as far as telling her about my counseling sessions, but she just wasn't interested. She only showed an interest when Haley was around."
    nvl_narrator "Jayne was also surprised by my continued relationship with Erin, she was a frequent topic of conversation during our sessions and had yet to be a positive subject. I think personally she agreed with Bethany and felt that I should end things with her, but due to the nature of our relationship she was professionally unable to give her true opinion."
    nvl_narrator "I hadn't seen Erin over Christmas, but had given her her gift just after. She hadn't got me a present and again failed to give me anything during the sex afterwards, instead she had let me get her off and then spent the next half hour roundly abusing the thoughtful book Haley had bought me."
    nvl_narrator "I saw red at that point and for the first time in six months bit back. It didn't go down well to say the least. I left the house to a torrent of verbal abuse, which ended in her telling me she wished I was dead, and then spent the evening in Bethany's arms while she calmed me down and wiped the angry tears from my face."
