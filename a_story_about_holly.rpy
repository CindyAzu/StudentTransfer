    She is right that I've cried less and less in each session, but I'm not actually all that sure we've made any real progress. It's been two months for Christ's sake. 
    Surely I shouldn't still be crying for more or less the whole hour after two fucking months?!"
    nvl_narrator "What frustrates me the most about these sessions is that we...or I, as the case may be...can't seem to pinpoint exactly how I got to feeling this way in the first place. 
    I work full time and am doing well in my part time degree, I can afford to pay my rent comfortably, 
    although we are getting a new house mate to ease some of the financial pressure. I live with my best friend Brad and his girlfriend Bethany, who I absolutely adore. 
    I feel so guilty that I want for nothing and yet here I am stuck in this downward spiral of despair and misery, while those a lot less fortunate than me just get on with things."

But there's just something about her I don't like, i can't even explain what it is, she just puts me off somehow."
